# Gravity-Monke
Customize your gravity in Gorilla Tag!

Simply download the DLL, put it in your BepInEx plugins folder, load Gorilla Tag and it should work!

To change the gravity, go over to the computer and click Enter on GravityMonke, then use the Left and Right arrows to change the number. 

IMPORTANT: Any number above 0 (1, 2, etc) will make you constantly float upwards.
