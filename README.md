# Gravity-Monke
Customize your gravity in Gorilla Tag!

Simply download the DLL, put it in your BepInEx plugins folder, load Gorilla Tag and it should work!

To change the gravity, go into the config file and change the "Gravity" value. 
If the game is loaded when you do this, you will need to turn the mod off on the Mod Status tab, then turn it back on.

Computer Interface support will come out in the future.
