# Gravity-Monke
Customize your gravity in Gorilla Tag!

Simply download the DLL, put it in your BepInEx plugins folder, load Gorilla Tag and it should work!

IMPORTANT! Before doing any of the things below, open the Gravity Monke view on the Computer Interface or it WILL break, I'll try to fix this next update.

To change the gravity, go over to the computer and click Enter on GravityMonke, then use the Left and Right arrows to change the number. 
Hold down the primary button on your right to controller to toggle Zero Gravity

Hold the Left Trigger and press the Secondary Button on your Right Controller to reset your Gravity to the Default. (Set the Defualt on the Computer)

To change your gravity without the computer, hold down the trigger on the left controller and use X/Y to adjust the gravity.
Holding down the left trigger also creates a UI on the back of your left hand that shows your gravity.

Settings now save.

IMPORTANT: Any number above 0 (1, 2, etc) will make you constantly float upwards.
